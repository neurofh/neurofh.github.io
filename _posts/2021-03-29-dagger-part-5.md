In the [previous](/posts/dagger-part-4/) post we've explored scope operators.

In this post we'll encounter subcomponents and their hierarchy, custom scopes and let's not waste any time.

Starting off by including the androidx.preferences library
```kotlin
implementation 'androidx.preference:preference-ktx:1.1.1'
```

Let's delete all the classes from previous posts and remove all of the code within **MainActivity** also rename **TestApplication** to 
```kotlin
class DaggerIsEasyApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
    }
}
```
Create a simple shared preference manager that'll hide most of the logic
```kotlin
@Singleton
class SharedPreferencesManager @Inject constructor(context: Context) {

    private companion object {
        private const val FIRST_TIME_LAUNCH_KEY = "firstTimeLaunch"
    }

    private val sharedPrefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(context)

    val firstTimeLaunchSinceInstall get() = sharedPrefs.getBoolean(FIRST_TIME_LAUNCH_KEY, true)
    fun appHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime() = sharedPrefs.edit(true) {
        putBoolean(FIRST_TIME_LAUNCH_KEY, false)
    }
}
```

Annotate it with the scope `@Singleton` because this instance needs to be alive for the app's lifetime since that's when we'll create the graph.

The second thing we do is create our component and we do the following
```kotlin
@Component
@Singleton
interface SingletonComponent {
    fun provideGraphInside(application: DaggerIsEasyApplication)
}
```
we press build or F10 and then we go in our **Application** inheritance to do the following
```kotlin
class DaggerIsEasyApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        DaggerSingletonComponent.create().provideGraphInside(this)
        super.onCreate()
        
    }
}
```
Now we get to the real deal, we need an instance of our **PreferenceManager** inside the application level, then we have something like.
```kotlin
class DaggerIsEasyApplication : Application() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var sharedPreferencesManager: SharedPreferencesManager

    override fun onCreate() {
        DaggerSingletonComponent.create().provideGraphInside(this)
        super.onCreate()
        

        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchSinceInstall){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "App is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.appHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }
    }
}
```
If we click compile, this will go ahead and compile but there's one big issue, when we run the app we get something like 
```kotlin
error: [Dagger/MissingBinding] android.content.Context cannot be provided without an @Provides-annotated method.
public abstract interface SingletonComponent
```

that's because we need a **Context** in our **SharedPreferencesManager**, let's to do the following changes in our SingletonComponent
```kotlin
@Component
@Singleton
interface SingletonComponent {
    @Component.Factory
    interface SingletonComponentFactory {
        fun create(@BindsInstance context: Context): SingletonComponent
    }

    fun provideGraphInside(application: DaggerIsEasyApplication)
}
```
We've learnt about a new citizen in the Dagger world
`@Component.Factory`
a factory has to create our component, because our component needs a parameter
in this case a *Context*, in order to create our **SharedPreferencesManager**, because Dagger doesn't know how to get a *Context* we have to provide it to Dagger ourselves.

Inside we have an interface which is essentially our factory and one important function called `create`, which returns (creates) the `SingletonComponent` but with a parameter of the type we wanted, in our case a `Context`.

Also there's `@BindsInstance`, this annotation knows about the type of the parameter in our case `Context` and later on whenever we request this `Context` within our `@Singleton` scope we'll have it provided to us by Dagger we don't have to do anything else (because this runtime variable is tied to the component's scope that binds it, in our case *SingletonComponent* and it's children, more about that later on).

As I mentioned earlier, Dagger would be far easier without Android's runtime, but `Context` is a runtime variable which is available once the app's started and that's what complicates things.

Now for the most important part, let's create the component with a runtime variable,
inside *DaggerIsEasyApplication* and after `onCreate()` just right before the `super` call
```kotlin
    override fun onCreate() {
        DaggerSingletonComponent.factory().create(this).provideGraphInside(this)
        super.onCreate()

        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchSinceInstall){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "App is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.appHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }
    }
```
now when we launch the application, we see the following log

<img src="/assets/img/dagger/5/1.png" alt ="" class="center">

when we rerun the app, we won't see the log.

Let's say we wanted to get that same **SharedPreferencesManager** in our `MainActivity`
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var sharedPreferencesManager: SharedPreferencesManager

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchMainActivitySinceInstall){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "Main activity is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.mainActivityHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }

    }
}
```
run the code and see it crash 💥
```kotlin
Caused by: kotlin.UninitializedPropertyAccessException: lateinit property sharedPreferencesManager has not been initialized
```

The first thing that we need to do is make our `ApplicationComponent` available to do more than one thing, so we expose it as a variable that we initialize with our `create(this)` and we also `provideGraphInside` the application level.
```kotlin
class DaggerIsEasyApplication : Application() {

    lateinit var applicationComponent: SingletonComponent
        private set

    @Inject
    lateinit var sharedPreferencesManager: SharedPreferencesManager

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        applicationComponent = DaggerSingletonComponent.factory().create(this).also { it.provideGraphInside(this) }

        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchSinceInstall) {
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "App is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.appHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }
    }
}
```
Now `SingletonComponent` is `@Singleton` scoped, that means we've gotta come with our own scoping if we need something inside an *Activity*.

```kotlin
@Scope
@MustBeDocumented
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class ActivityScoped
```

as we know that we need an Activity component as well, we create one too,
now this time we annotate it with `@Subcomponent` and annotate it with our own scope `ActivityScoped`.
Since this is a subcomponent we need a `@Subcomponent.Factory` just like we did with the singleton component (there it was a Component.Factory).
```kotlin
@Subcomponent
@ActivityScoped
interface ActivityComponent {

    @Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): ActivityComponent
    }

    fun inject(mainActivity: MainActivity)
}
```

The main idea here is that the `SingletonComponent` is the parent and `ActivityComponent` is it's child.

We have to make sure of that, now inside our `SingletonComponent` we provide the factory that creates `ActivityComponent`.

`ActivityComponent` is a child, that means every module we include in the `SingletonComponent` and instance annotated with `@BindsInstance` would be available inside the `ActivityComponent` as well, since it's like `ActivityComponent` inherited the public variables from `SingletonComponent` that were annotated with `@BindsInstance`.

```kotlin
@Component
@Singleton
interface SingletonComponent {
    @Component.Factory
    interface SingletonComponentFactory {
        fun create(@BindsInstance context: Context): SingletonComponent
    }
    fun activityComponentFactory() : ActivityComponent.Factory
    fun provideGraphInside(application: DaggerIsEasyApplication)
}
```
the last thing we do is call the creation, that happens inside our `MainActivity` right before `onCreate()`, just like in our Application.
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var sharedPreferencesManager: SharedPreferencesManager

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        (application as DaggerIsEasyApplication).applicationComponent.activityComponentFactory().create().also { 
            it.inject(this)
        }
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)


        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchMainActivitySinceInstall){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "Main activity is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.mainActivityHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }

    }
}
```
When we run the app we can see that we're suffering from success.

<img src="/assets/img/dagger/5/2.png" alt ="" class="center">

For demonstrational purposes, we want to have `savedInstanceState: Bundle?` as a runtime variable and the `intent` within the `ActivityScoped` instances, change the `ActivityComponent's` *subcomponent factory*

```kotlin
@Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(@BindsInstance savedInstanceState: Bundle?,
                   @BindsInstance intent: Intent): ActivityComponent
    }
```
and 
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    (application as DaggerIsEasyApplication).applicationComponent.activityComponentFactory().create(savedInstanceState, intent).also {it.inject(this)}
```

Let's pretend that we have a class `IntentHandler` coming from a library that we didn't create,
and we included it as an implementation, that class receives an `Intent` param.
```kotlin
class IntentHandler(private val intent: Intent) {

    fun getObfuscatedClipData() = obfuscate(intent.clipData)

    private fun obfuscate(clipData: ClipData?): ClipData? {
        //some magic obfuscation
        //call it magic
        //call it true
        return clipData
    }
}
```

since we don't own that class, we have to create a module and make Dagger be aware of it.

```kotlin
@Module
object ActivityModule {
    @Provides
    @ActivityScoped
    fun intentHandler(intent: Intent) = IntentHandler(intent)
}
```
we use `@Provides` since the code is coming from outside of our own project, otherwise we could've
just annotated the class with `@ActivityScoped` and `@Inject constructor()` and voila.

However can do the following for example:
```kotlin
@ActivityScoped
class Bundler @Inject constructor(private val savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

    fun unbundle(){
        savedInstanceState // > perform some magic
    }
}
```
we've already provided the runtime argument of `savedInstanceState: Bundle?` using `@BindsInstance`, now we can play with it.

Our activity looks like:
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var sharedPreferencesManager: SharedPreferencesManager

    @Inject
    lateinit var intentHandler: IntentHandler

    @Inject
    lateinit var bundler: Bundler

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        (application as DaggerIsEasyApplication).applicationComponent.activityComponentFactory().create(
            savedInstanceState, intent
        ).also {it.inject(this)}
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)


        if (sharedPreferencesManager.firstTimeLaunchMainActivitySinceInstall){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "Main activity is launched for the first time since installation time")
            sharedPreferencesManager.mainActivityHasBeenLaunchedForTheFirstTime()
        }

        if (intentHandler.getObfuscatedClipData() != null){
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "send obfuscated clip data to server")
        } else {
            Log.d(this::class.java.simpleName, "obfuscated data not available, ignore")
        }

        bundler.unbundle()
    }
}
```

Let's tidy up the tings a little bit, create a file called `DaggerExtensions` and inside
```kotlin
inline fun AppCompatActivity.injector(action: SingletonComponent.() -> Unit) {
    (application as DaggerIsEasyApplication).applicationComponent.action()
}
```
<img src="/assets/img/dagger/5/3.png" alt ="" class="center">

let's enjoy a bit tidier code, even tidier when we'll start using *Hilt* in the future articles. 

Some might argue that you'll replace vanilla Dagger completely, well... not quite, inside feature modules you'll still need to know the concepts (especially factories and components) of pure Dagger, because Hilt doesn't entirely replace Dagger, it's built on top of Dagger to abstract away the Android's runtime boilerplate setup that you have to do every time you create a new project.
